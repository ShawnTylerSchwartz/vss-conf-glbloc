Your goal is to try to remember the locations of the objects within the grid to the best of your ability.</p><p>You will be presented with a grid for a total of 30 seconds. Please study the location of the items within the grid. After the 30 seconds has elapsed, the grid will automatically disappear and you will be shown a blank grid with the various objects underneath.</p><p>Your goal is to place each object in its correct location by dragging (click and hold) on the object from the bottom and dropping the item into the cell you wish to place the item into. If you are not sure where an object was presented, please make a guess at its correct location.</p><p>After you have placed all of the objects in the grid, you will be asked to provide a rating of how many of the items you think are correctly placed ranging from 0 items (none correctly placed) to 10 items (all items correctly placed).</p>",,off

Your total score depends on how many items you correctly placed.</p><p>In this task, the objects within the grid will differ in value. The value of the objects will range from 1 to 10 and will be indicated in the top left corner of each cell.</p><p>Your total score depends on the point values of the objects you correctly placed. If you correctly place an object that is worth 8 points you will receive 8 points towards your total score. If you correctly place an object that is worth 3 points you will receive 3 points towards your total score. You will not be penalized for misplacing items, so if you're not sure, please try to guess the item's location. Your goal is to maximize your total score.</p><p>The next screen will show you an example.</p>",,off
